# Frontend Design Skill

Create unique, memorable frontend interfaces that stand out from generic designs.

## Design Thinking Process

Before coding, establish a **bold aesthetic direction**:

1. **Purpose**: What problem does this solve? Who are the users?
2. **Tone**: Choose extreme direction (minimalist, maximalist, retro-futuristic, organic, luxury, playful, editorial, brutalist, art-deco, soft-pastel, industrial)
3. **Constraints**: Technical requirements
4. **Differentiation**: What makes this memorable?

## Aesthetic Guidelines

### Typography
- Choose beautiful, distinctive fonts
- AVOID generic fonts (Arial, Inter)
- Pair display fonts with body fonts thoughtfully

### Color & Theme
- Establish cohesive aesthetic direction
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Dominant color + sharp accents

### Motion & Animation
- CSS-only for HTML artifacts
- React Motion libraries for React
- One well-orchestrated animation (staggered reveals) > scattered micro-interactions

### Spatial Composition
- Unexpected layouts
- Asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flows
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

### Visual Details
- Create atmosphere and depth
- Gradient meshes, noise, geometric patterns
- Layered transparencies, dramatic shadows
- Decorative borders, custom cursors, grain overlays

## Avoid Generic AI Aesthetics

- Overused fonts and purple gradients
- Predictable, centered layouts
- Cookie-cutter designs without context
- Same rounded corners everywhere

## Implementation Principle

**Complexity = Aesthetic Vision**
- Maximalist design → sophisticated code
- Minimalist design → precise, delicate details

Each design should be unique. Vary light/dark themes, font choices, and avoid convergent common choices.
